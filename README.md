# vacuum-tube
I’m working on this NES Emulator on the side of school and whatnot. I kinda just want a fun project and this sounds cool, so I’m working on it now. If you have any suggestions, feel free to leave a post in issues and I will look at it. Thanks!
The name is inspired by old vacuum tube televisions that had to be replaced often and were eventually replaced with current technology.
